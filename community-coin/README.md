| `GET`  | `/leaderboard`            | View the leaderboard (cached).            |
| `GET`  | `/history/:address`       | Retrieve the transaction history for a user. |
| `GET`  | `/stats`                  | Get blockchain statistics.                |
| `GET`  | `/verify`                 | Verify the integrity of the blockchain.   |
| `GET`  | `/pending`                | View pending transactions.                |
| `POST` | `/add-block`              | Add a new block to the chain.             |
| `GET`  | `/chain`                  | Get the full blockchain.                  |
| `GET`  | `/health`                 | Check the health of the service.          |

### Usage Examples

-   **Send Coins:**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/transfer \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"from":"alice","to":"bob","amount":100}'
    ```

-   **Check Balance:**

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/wallet/alice
    ```

-   **Mine Block:**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mine \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"proposer":"alice"}'
    ```

## üíª CLI Wallet

Community Coin also includes a command-line interface (CLI) wallet for easy interaction with the blockchain.

### Installation

The CLI is built along with the main application:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Usage

-   **Check Balance:**

    ```bash
    ./target/release/cli wallet balance <ADDRESS>
    ```

-   **Transfer Coins:**

    ```bash
    ./target/release/cli wallet transfer --from <FROM> --to <TO> --amount <AMOUNT> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
    ```

-   **Get History:**

    ```bash
    ./target/release/cli wallet history <ADDRESS>
    ```

## üìù Smart Contracts

Community Coin supports general-purpose smart contracts written in any language that can be compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm).

### Writing Smart Contracts

Smart contracts interact with the blockchain through a defined ABI. An example "counter" contract written in Rust can be found in the `example-contract` directory.

### Deploying Smart Contracts

Use the CLI to deploy a smart contract:

```bash
./target/release/cli contract deploy --path <PATH_TO_WASM_FILE> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

### Executing Smart Contracts

Use the CLI to execute a function on a deployed smart contract:

```bash
./target/release/cli contract execute --contract-id <CONTRACT_ID> --function <FUNCTION_NAME> --args <ARGS_JSON> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Shared Security

Community Coin uses a shared security model inspired by EigenLayer to secure the network. Validators stake assets on a simulated Settlement Layer, and their attestations are required to validate new blocks.

### Becoming a Validator

To become a validator, you must stake assets on the Settlement Layer. This can be done via the CLI:

```bash
./target/release/cli validator stake --amount <AMOUNT> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

### Slashing

Validators who act maliciously (e.g., by signing conflicting blocks) will have their stake slashed.

## üåê P2P Networking

Community Coin uses `libp2p` to create a peer-to-peer network for discovering other nodes and sharing transactions and blocks.

### Running Multiple Nodes

To run multiple nodes on the same machine, you can specify a different API port and P2P port for each node:

**Node 1:**

```bash
cargo run --release -- --api-port 8000 --p2p-port 10000
```

**Node 2:**

```bash
cargo run --release -- --api-port 8001 --p2p-port 10001
```

The nodes will automatically discover each other on the local network using mDNS.
